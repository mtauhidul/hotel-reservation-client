  "aboutDetails": "We welcome you with pleasure in the heart of the Pays d'Ouche, in Haute-Normandie, in Rugles, in a house of character and charm, decorated by us to bring it the comfort of modernity while respecting its authenticity. we gave the name of 'Clos Saint-Germain', because the property is enclosed by walls, out of sight: which forms a closed. Saint-Germain because it is the name of the church of Rugles; moreover, in certain places of the house, we can see the bell tower. Moreover Saint-Germain was a Burgundian bishop (of Auxerre from 418 to 448). Myself originally from Burgundy, it is also a nod to my origins. Le Clos Saint-Germain is a guest house in a bourgeois town house dating from 1860, composed of 5 bedrooms (with wifi), 3 living rooms (with board games, books), a dining room, a billiard room, a terrace (facing south) with deckchairs and deck chairs and glass roof, a private garden, enclosed without vis-à-vis. commissioned by Calixte Marquis, an industrialist in the steel industry at the time. We also offer a table d'hôtes, with two ranges of menus, by reservation. nearest railway station: L'Aigle. Transfer possible, extra. A few words about Saint-Germain and the characters who inspired our rooms: (Perhaps the presentations of Saint-Germain and the 5 names that inspired our rooms are too detailed and need further refinement) ?Germain d'Auxerre or Germain l'Auxerrois (° v. 380 in Appoigny near Auxerre, Yonne - † July 31, 448 in Ravenna, Italy) appointed 6th bishop of Auxerre in 418. He is a Christian saint, the most famous of Saints Germain.Germain was born in Appoigny, 12 km north of Auxerre.Germain is a contemporary of Saint Augustine and Saint John Chrysostom. His era is that of the great invasions, the beginning of the collapse of the Roman Empire, a Christian doctrine still poorly framed and where differences abound. Son of aristocrats, he studied in Auxerre or Autun, then in Rome, and becomes a reputable lawyer. He marries Eustachie. He returned to Gaul, where he was appointed duke and governor (imperial official) of several provinces. The duchy of which Germain is in charge is that of the Marche Armorique, which includes the Roman provinces of the first and the second Aquitaine, the second and the third Lyonnaise, and the Sénonaise. Germain established his residence in Auxerre, but he was required to visit himself the large territories for which he is responsible and is often and long absent. The bishop of Auxerre at the time was Saint Amâtre (b. 386–418) and their relations were not the best: Germain, like many aristocrats, hunted and followed the local custom of displaying the heads of his taken by hanging them from a large pear tree. There, Amâtre has the revelation that Germain will be his successor as bishop of Auxerre. He asked Julius for permission to make Germain a cleric of the Church, returned to Auxerre and converted Germain, 'gave him the tonsure'' and made him a deacon and then a priest. Germain as his successor to the bishopric of Auxerre; a charge that Germain accepts, it is said, against his will, but that he will assume until his death, that is from 418 to 448. Having become a bishop, Germain founded the monastery of Saint-Cosme and Saint-Damien opposite Auxerre , on the right bank of the Yonne. Saint Patrick, preacher and future first bishop of Ireland, stayed in Auxerre for many years (perhaps 18 years). Germain was buried on October 1 in a small oratory north of Auxerre dedicated to Saint Maurice. Clotilde, wife of Clovis, had a church dedicated to Saint Germain built in place of the oratory, which became the church of the abbey of the same name. Each of our rooms bears the name of a personality who has marked or lived in the region.",
